# Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when the function is called (invoked). You can use functions to make your code reusable, better organised and more readable.

There are at least **four** types of functions in Python:

* built-in functions e.g. `print()`, `input()`
* pre-installed modules
* user-defined functions
* `lambda` functions

## Parameterized Functions

Information can be passed to functions by using parameters. It can have as many parameters as you need.

* **Positional parameter passing** - the order of arguments passed matters

* **Keyword argument passing** - the order of arguments passed doesn't matter

* a mix of positional and keyword parameters can be combined. (Note: positional arguments must not follow keyword arguments)
